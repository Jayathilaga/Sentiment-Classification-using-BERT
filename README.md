The Afghani chicken was uncooked in the center, when I got it to the notice of the server she said that's the set oven temperature and that's how it is made and did nothing about it. I'm attaching pictures for others to see how pathetic the service recovery can be. I mean we're paying for our meal. Not eating for free right? No water was offered during the course of our dine in. The manager, please be mindful of the people you hire. Thanks. Wouldn't visit again or recommend to anyone!"
